    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 pound) loaf Italian bread</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Cut loaf into ten 1-inch slices.</li>   
        <li>Mix butter, garlic, oil, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; spread butter mixture on one side of each slice of bread; arrange bread slices, butter-side up, in a single layer on a baking sheet.</li>   
        <li>Cook under the preheated broiler until slightly brown, checking frequently so they do not burn, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top bread slices with cheese and return to broiler until cheese is slightly brown and melted, about 2 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
